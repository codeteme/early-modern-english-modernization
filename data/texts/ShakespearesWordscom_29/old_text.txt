SIr Hugh , perswade me not: I will make
a Star-Chamber matter of it, if hee were twenty Sir
Iohn Falstoffs , he shall not abuse Robert Shallow
Esquire.
Slen.
In the County of Glocester , Iustice of Peace and
Coram.

Bill, Warrant, Quittance, or Obligation, Armigero .
Shal.
I that I doe, and haue done any time these
three hundred yeeres.
Slen.
All his successors (gone before him) hath don't:
and all his Ancestors (that come after him) may: they may
giue the dozen white Luces in their Coate .
Shal.
It is an olde Coate.
Euans.
The dozen white Lowses doe become an old Coat well:
it agrees well passant: It is a familiar beast to man, and
signifies Loue.
Shal.
The Luse is the fresh-fish, the salt-fish, is an
old Coate.
Slen.
I may quarter (Coz).
Shal.
You may, by marrying.
Euans.
It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
Shal.
Not a whit.
Euan.
Yes per-lady: if he ha's a quarter of your coat,
there is but three Skirts for your selfe, in my simple
coniectures; but that is all one: if Sir Iohn Falstaffe
haue committed disparagements vnto you, I am of the
Church and will be glad to do my beneuolence, to make
attonements and compremises betweene you.
Shal.
The Councell shall heare it, it is a Riot.
Euan.
It is not meet the Councell heare a Riot: there is no
feare of Got in a Riot: The Councell (looke you) shall desire
to heare the feare of Got, and not to heare a Riot: take your
viza-ments in that.
Shal.
Ha; o'my life, if I were yong againe, the

Gold, and Siluer, is her Grand-sire vpon his deaths-bed,
(Got deliuer to a ioyfull resurrections) giue, when she is

motion, if we leaue our pribbles and prabbles, and desire
a marriage betweene Master Abraham , and Mistris Anne
Page .

Did her Grand-sire leaue her seauen hundred
pound?
Euan.

M. Pa.
It could not be iudg'd , Sir.
Slen.
You'll not confesse: you'll not confesse.
Shal.
That he will not, 'tis your fault, 'tis your
fault: 'tis a good dogge.
M. Pa.
A Cur, Sir.
Shal.
Sir: hee's a good dog, and a faire dog, can there
be more said? he is good, and faire. Is Sir Iohn Falstaffe
heere?
M. Pa.

office betweene you.
Euan.
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speake.
Shal.
He hath wrong'd me (Master Page .)
M. Pa.
Sir, he doth in some sort confesse it.
Shal.
If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that
so (M. Page ?) he hath wrong'd me, indeed he hath,
at a word he hath: beleeue me, Robert Shallow
Esquire, saith he is wronged.
Ma. Pa.
Here comes Sir Iohn .
Fal.
Now, Master Shallow , you'll complaine of me to
the King?
Shal.
Knight, you haue beaten my men, kill'd my
deere, and broke open my Lodge.
Fal.
But not kiss'd your Keepers daughter?
Shal.
Tut, a pin: this shall be answer'd .
Fal.
I will answere it strait , I haue done all this:
That is now answer'd.
Shal.
The Councell shall know this.
Fal.
'Twere better for you if it were known in
councell : you'll be laugh'd at.
Eu.
Pauca verba ; (Sir Iohn ) good worts.
Fal.
Good worts? good Cabidge; Slender , I
broke your head: what matter haue you against me?
Slen.
Marry sir, I haue matter in my head against
you, and against your cony-catching Rascalls, Bardolf ,
Nym , and Pistoll .
Bar.
You Banbery Cheese.
Slen.
I, it is no matter.
Pist.
How now, Mephostophilus ?
Slen.
I, it is no matter.
Nym.
Slice, I say; pauca, pauca : Slice, that's my humor .
Slen.
Where's Simple my man? can you tell,
Cosen?
Eua.
Peace, I pray you: now let vs vnderstand : there is
three Vmpires in this matter, as I vnderstand; that is,
Master Page (fidelicet Master Page ,) & there is my selfe,
(fidelicet my selfe) and the three party is (lastly, and finally)
mine Host of the Gater.
Ma. Pa.
We three to hear it, & end it between them.
Euan.
Ferry goo't, I will make a priefe of it in my note-booke,
and we wil afterwards orke vpon the cause, with as great
discreetly as we can.
Fal.
Pistoll .
Pist.
He heares with eares.
Euan.
The Teuill and his Tam: what phrase is this? he
heares with eare? why, it is affectations.
Fal.
Pistoll , did you picke M. Slenders purse?
Slen.
I, by these gloues did hee, or I would I
might neuer come in mine owne great chamber againe
else, of seauen groates in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
Shouelboords , that cost me two shilling and two pence
a peece of Yead Miller: by these gloues.
Fal.
Is this true, Pistoll ?
Euan.
No, it is false, if it is a picke-purse .
Pist.
Ha, thou mountaine Forreyner: Sir Iohn , and Master mine,
I combat challenge of this Latine Bilboe :
word of deniall in thy labras here;
word of denial; froth, and scum thou liest.
Slen.
By these gloues, then 'twas he.
Nym.
Be auis'd sir, and passe good humours : I will say
marry trap with you, if you runne the nut-hooks humor
on me, that is the very note of it.
Slen.
By this hat, then he in the red face had it: for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made
me drunke, yet I am not altogether an asse.
Fal.
What say you Scarlet , and Iohn ?
Bar.
Why sir, (for my part) I say the Gentleman
had drunke himselfe out of his fiue sentences.
Eu.
It is his fiue sences: fie, what the ignorance is.
Bar.
And being fap, sir, was (as they say) casheerd :
and so conclusions past the Car-eires .
Slen.
I, you spake in Latten then to: but 'tis no
matter; Ile nere be drunk whilst I liue againe, but in
honest, ciuill, godly company for this tricke: if I be
drunke, Ile be drunke with those that haue the feare of
God, and not with drunken knaues .
Euan.
So got-udge me, that is a vertuous minde .
Fal.
You heare all these matters deni'd, Gentlemen;
you heare it.
M r . Page.
Nay daughter, carry the wine in, wee'll drinke
within.
Slen.
Oh heauen: This is Mistresse Anne Page .
M r . Page.
How now Mistris Ford ?
Fal.
Mistris Ford , by my troth you are very wel
met: by your leaue good Mistris.
M r . Page.
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome: come, we
haue a hot Venison pasty to dinner; Come gentlemen, I
hope we shall drinke downe all vnkindnesse.
Slen.
I had rather then forty shillings I had my booke
of Songs and Sonnets heere:
How now Simple , where haue you beene? I must wait
on my selfe, must I? you haue not the booke of Riddles
about you, haue you?
Sim.
Booke of Riddles? why did you not lend it to
Alice Short-cake vpon Alhallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas.
Shal.
Come Coz, come Coz, we stay for you: a word
with you Coz: marry this, Coz: there is as 'twere a
tender, a kinde of tender, made a farre-off by Sir Hugh
here: doe you vnderstand me?
Slen.
I Sir, you shall finde me reasonable; if it be
so, I shall doe that that is reason.
Shal.
Nay, but vnderstand me.
Slen.
So I doe Sir.
Euan.
Giue eare to his motions; (M r . Slender ) I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
Slen.
Nay, I will doe as my Cozen Shallow saies: I
pray you pardon me, he's a Iustice of Peace in his
Countrie , simple though I stand here.
Euan.
But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.
Shal.
I, there's the point Sir.
Eu.
Marry is it: the very point of it, to Mi. An
Page .
Slen.
Why if it be so; I will marry her vpon any
reasonable demands.
Eu.
But can you affection the 'o-man, let vs command
to know that of your mouth, or of your lips: for diuers
Philosophers hold, that the lips is parcell of the mouth:
therfore precisely, cã you carry your good wil to
y e maid?
Sh.
Cosen Abraham Slender , can you loue her?
Slen.
I hope sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would doe reason.
Eu.
Nay, got's Lords, and his Ladies, you must speake
possitable, if you can carry-her your desires towards
her.
Shal.
That you must: Will you, (vpon good dowry)
marry her?
Slen.
I will doe a greater thing then that, vpon your
request (Cosen) in any reason.
Shal.
Nay conceiue me, conceiue mee, (sweet Coz):
what I doe is to pleasure you (Coz:) can you loue the maid?
Slen.
I will marry her (Sir) at your request; but if
there bee no great loue in the beginning, yet Heauen may
decrease it vpon better acquaintance, when wee are
married, and haue more occasion to know one another:
I hope vpon familiarity will grow more content: but if
you say mary-her, I will mary-her, that I am freely
dissolued , and dissolutely.
Eu.
It is a fery discetion-answere; saue the fall is in the
'ord, dissolutely: the ort is (according to our meaning)
resolutely: his meaning is good.
Sh.
I: I thinke my Cosen meant well.
Sl.
I, or else I would I might be hang'd (la.)
Sh.
Here comes faire Mistris Anne ; would I
were yong for your sake, Mistris Anne .
An.
The dinner is on the Table, my Father desires your
worships company.
Sh.
I will wait on him, (faire Mistris Anne .)
Eu.
Od's plessed-wil: I wil not be absẽce at the
grace.
An.
Wil't please your worship to come in, Sir?
Sl.
No, I thank you forsooth, hartely; I am very
well.
An.
The dinner attends you, Sir.
Sl.
I am not a-hungry, I thanke you, forsooth:
goe, Sirha, for all you are my man, goe wait
vpon my Cosen Shallow:
a Iustice of peace sometime may be beholding to his
friend, for a Man; I keepe but three Men, and a Boy yet,
till my Mother be dead: but what though, yet I liue
like a poore Gentleman borne.
An.
I may not goe in without your worship: they will
not sit till you come.
Sl.
I'faith, ile eate nothing: I thanke you as much as
though I did.
An.
I pray you Sir walke in .
Sl.
I had rather walke here (I thanke you) I bruiz'd my
shin th'other day, with playing at Sword and Dagger with
a Master of Fence (three veneys for a dish of stew'd
Prunes) and by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of
hot meate since. Why doe your dogs barke so? be there
Beares ith' Towne?
An.
I thinke there are, Sir, I heard them talk'd of.
Sl.
I loue the sport well, but I shall as soone quarrell
at it, as any man in England: you are afraid if you see the
Beare loose, are you not?
An.
I indeede Sir.
Sl.
That's meate and drinke to me now: I haue seene
Sackerson loose, twenty times, and haue taken him by
the Chaine: but (I warrant you) the women haue so cride
and shrekt at it, that it past : But women indeede,
cannot abide 'em, they are very ill-fauour'd rough
things.
Ma. Pa.
Come, gentle M. Slender , come; we stay for
you.
Sl.
Ile eate nothing, I thanke you Sir.
Ma. Pa.
By cocke and pie, you shall not choose, Sir: come,
come.
Sl.
Nay, pray you lead the way.
Ma. Pa.
Come on, Sir.
Sl.
Mistris Anne: your selfe shall goe first.
An.
Not I Sir, pray you keepe on .
Sl.
Truely I will not goe first: truely-la: I will not doe
you that wrong.
An.
I pray you Sir.
Sl.
Ile rather be vnmannerly, then troublesome:
you doe your selfe wrong indeede-la.
Exeunt .
