A tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard:
Enter a Ship-master, and a Boteswaine.
Master .
BOte-swaine.
Botes .
Heere Master: What cheere?
Mast .
Good: Speake to th' Mariners: fall too't, yarely, or
we run our selues a ground, bestirre , bestirre .
Exit .
Enter Mariners.
Botes .
Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my
harts: yare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to
th' Masters whistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if
room enough.
Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo,
and others.
Alon.
Good Boteswaine haue care: where's the Master?
Play the men.
Botes .
I pray now keepe below.
Anth .
Where is the Master, Boson?
Botes .
Do you not heare him? you marre our labour,
Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.
Gonz .
Nay, good be patient.
Botes .
When the Sea is: hence, what cares these
roarers for the name of King? to Cabine; silence:
trouble vs not.
Gon .
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboord.
Botes .
None that I more loue then my selfe. You are
a Counsellor, if you can command these Elements to
silence, and worke the peace of the present, wee will not
hand a rope more, vse your authoritie: If you cannot,
giue thankes you haue liu'd so long, and make your selfe
readie in your Cabine for the mischance of the houre, if it
so hap. Cheerely good hearts: out of our way I
say.
Exit .
Gon .
I haue great comfort from this fellow: methinks
he hath no drowning marke vpon him, his complexion
is perfect Gallowes : stand fast good Fate to his
hanging, make the rope of his destiny our cable, for
our owne doth little aduantage : If he be not borne to bee
hang'd, our case is miserable.
Exit .
Enter Boteswaine.
Botes .
Downe with the top-Mast: yare, lower,
lower, bring her to Try with Maine-course .
A cry within.
A plague --- vpon this howling: they are lowder then the
weather, or our office:
Enter Sebastian, Anthonio & Gonzalo.
yet againe? What do you heere? Shal we giue ore and
drowne, haue you a minde to sinke?
Sebas .
A poxe o'your throat, you bawling, blasphemous
incharitable Dog.
Botes .
Worke you then.
Anth .
Hang cur, hang, you whoreson insolent Noyse-maker,
we are lesse afraid to be drownde, then thou art.
Gonz .
I'le warrant him for drowning, though the Ship
were no stronger then a Nutt-shell, and as leaky as an
vnstanched wench.
Botes .
Lay her a hold, a hold, set her two courses
off to Sea againe, lay her off.
Enter Mariners wet.
Mari.
All lost, to prayers, to prayers, all lost.
Botes .
What must our mouths be cold?
Gonz .
The King, and Prince, at prayers, let's assist them,
for our case is as theirs.
Sebas .
I'am out of patience.
An.
We are meerly cheated of our liues by drunkards,
This wide-chopt-rascall , would thou mightst lye drowning
the washing of ten Tides.
Gonz .
Hee'l be hang'd yet,
Though euery drop of water sweare against it,
And gape at widst to glut him.
A confused noyse within . Mercy on vs. We
split, we split, Farewell my wife, and children,
Farewell brother: we split, we split, we
split.
Anth .
Let's all sinke with' King
Seb
Let's take leaue of him.
Exit.
Gonz .
Now would I giue a thousand furlongs of Sea,
for an Acre of barren ground: Long heath, Browne firrs ,
any thing; the wills aboue be done, but I would faine dye
a dry death.
Exit .
