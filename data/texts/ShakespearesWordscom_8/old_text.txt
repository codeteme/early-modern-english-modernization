======================================================================

Enter Demetrius and Philo .
Philo.
NAy, but this dotage of our Generals
Ore-flowes the measure: those his goodly eyes
That o're the Files and Musters of the Warre,
Haue glow'd like plated Mars: / Now bend, now turne
The Office and Deuotion of their view
Vpon a Tawny Front. His Captaines heart,
Which in the scuffles of great Fights hath burst
The Buckles on his brest, reneages all temper,
And is become the Bellowes and the Fan
To coole a Gypsies Lust.
Flourish . Enter Anthony, Cleopatra, her Ladies,
the Traine, with Eunuchs fanning
her .
Looke where they come:
Take but good note, and you shall see in him
(The triple Pillar of the world) transform'd
Into a Strumpets Foole . Behold and see.
Cleo.
If it be Loue indeed, tell me how much.
Ant.
There's beggery in the loue that can be reckon'd
Cleo.
Ile set a bourne how farre to be belou'd.
Ant.
Then must thou needes finde out new Heauen, new Earth.
Enter a Messenger .
Mes.
Newes (my good Lord) from Rome.
Ant.
Grates me, the summe .
Cleo.
Nay heare them Anthony .
Fuluia perchance is angry: Or who knowes,
If the scarse-bearded Casar haue not sent
His powrefull Mandate to you. Do this, or this;
Take in that Kingdome, and Infranchise that:
Perform't, or else we damne thee.
Ant.
How, my Loue?
Cleo.
Perchance? Nay, and most like:
You must not stay heere longer, your dismission
Is come from Casar , therefore heare it Anthony
Where's Fuluias Processe ? ( Casars I would say) both?
Call in the Messengers: As I am Egypts Queene,
Thou blushest Anthony , and that blood of thine
Is Casars homager: else so thy cheeke payes shame,
When shrill-tongu'd Fuluia scolds. The Messengers.
Ant.
Let Rome in Tyber melt, and the wide Arch
Of the raing'd Empire fall: Heere is my space,
Kingdomes are clay: Our dungie earth alike
Feeds Beast as Man; the Noblenesse of life
Is to do thus: when such a mutuall paire,
And such a twaine can doo't, in which I binde
One paine of punishment, the world to weete
We stand vp Peerelesse.
Cleo.
Excellent falshood:
Why did he marry Fuluia , and not loue her?
Ile seeme the Foole I am not. Anthony
will be himselfe.
Ant
But stirr'd by Cleopatra .
Now for the loue of Loue, and her soft houres,
Let's not confound the time with Conference harsh;
There's not a minute of our liues should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport to night?
Cleo.
Heare the Ambassadors.
Ant.
Fye wrangling Queene:
Whom euery thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
To weepe: who euery passion fully striues
To make it selfe (in Thee) faire, and admir'd.
No Messenger but thine, and all alone,
to night / Wee'l wander through the streets, and note
The qualities of people. Come my Queene,
Last night you did desire it. Speake not to vs.
Exeunt with the Traine .
Dem.
Is Casar with Anthonius priz'd so slight?
Philo.
Sir sometimes when he is not Anthony ,
He comes too short of that great Property
Which still should go with Anthony .
Dem.
I am full sorry,
that hee approues the common / Lyar, who
thus speakes of him at Rome; but I will hope
of better deeds to morrow. Rest you happy.
Exeunt
