======================================================================

Enter two Gentlemen.
1. Gent.
YOu do not meet a man but Frownes. / Our bloods
no more obey the Heauens / Then our Courtiers:
Still seeme, as do's the Kings.
2 Gent.
But what's the matter?
1.
His daughter, and the heire of's kingdome (whom
He purpos'd to his wiues sole Sonne, a Widdow
That late he married) hath referr'd her selfe
Vnto a poore, but worthy Gentleman. She's wedded,
Her Husband banish'd; she imprison'd, all
Is outward sorrow, though I thinke the King
Be touch'd at very heart.
2
None but the King?
1
He that hath lost her too: so is the Queene,
That most desir'd the Match. But not a Courtier,
Although they weare their faces to the bent
Of the Kings lookes, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowle at.
2
And why so?
1
He that hath miss'd the Princesse, is a thing
Too bad, for bad report: and he that hath her,
(I meane, that married her, alacke good man,
And therefore banish'd) is a Creature, such,
As to seeke through the Regions of the Earth
For one, his like; there would be something failing
In him, that should compare. I do not thinke,
So faire an Outward, and such stuffe Within
Endowes a man, but hee.
2
You speake him farre .
1
I do extend him (Sir) within himselfe,
Crush him together, rather then vnfold
His measure duly.
2
What's his name, and Birth?
1
I cannot delue him to the roote: His Father
Was call'd Sicillius, who did ioyne his Honor
Against the Romanes, with Cassibulan,
But had his Titles by Tenantius, whom
He seru'd with Glory, and admir'd Successe:
So gain'd the Sur-addition, Leonatus.
And had (besides this Gentleman in question)
Two other Sonnes, who in the Warres o'th'time
Dy'de with their Swords in hand. For which, their Father
Then old, and fond of yssue , tooke such sorrow
That he quit Being; and his gentle Lady
Bigge of this Gentleman (our Theame) deceast
As he was borne. The King he takes the Babe
To his protection, cals him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breedes him, and makes him of his Bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the Learnings that his time
Could make him the receiuer of, which he tooke
As we do ayre, fast as 'twas ministred,
And in's Spring, became a Haruest: Liu'd in Court
(Which rare it is to do) most prais'd, most lou'd,
A sample to the yongest: to th'more Mature,
A glasse that feated them: and to the grauer,
A Childe that guided Dotards. To his Mistris,
(For whom he now is banish'd) her owne price
Proclaimes how she esteem'd him; and his Vertue
By her electiõ may be truly read,
what kind of man he is.
2
I honor him,
euen out of your report. / But pray you tell me,
is she sole childe to'th'King?
1
His onely childe:
He had two Sonnes (if this be worth your hearing,
Marke it) the eldest of them, at three yeares old
I'th' swathing cloathes , the other from their Nursery
Were stolne, and to this houre, no ghesse in knowledge
Which way they went.
2
How long is this ago ?
1
Some twenty yeares.
2
That a Kings Children should be so conuey'd ,
So slackely guarded, and the search so slow
That could not trace them.
1
Howsoere, 'tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at:
Yet is it true Sir.
2
I do well beleeue you.
1
We must forbeare . Heere comes the Gentleman,
The Queene, and Princesse.
Exeunt
