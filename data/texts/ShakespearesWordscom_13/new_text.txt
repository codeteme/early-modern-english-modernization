Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches
FIRST WITCH
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
SECOND WITCH
When the hurly-burly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.
THIRD WITCH
That will be ere the set of sun.
FIRST WITCH
Where the place?
SECOND WITCH
Upon the heath.
THIRD WITCH
There to meet with Macbeth.
FIRST WITCH
I come, Grey-Malkin.
SECOND WITCH
Paddock calls!
THIRD WITCH
Anon!
ALL
Fair is foul, and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Exeunt
