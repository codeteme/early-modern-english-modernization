The loue betweene them was vntender and full of euill
He hath deseruing newes from the yeere past
Speakes thou of broyles and knaues in this seruice
The doores were wash'd and the groues growne faire heere
My motiue was to recompence thy handy-worke
Vnfriended deuill with grossely chang'd braines
The Ieweller moues with conueniently harts
Their themselues liue among the peoples honor
