Thou art most heartily welcome to this place, good sir.
Methinks the weather doth portend a storme this euening.
I cannot conceiue why thou wouldst refuse such a generous offer.
Prithee tell me wherefore thou hast forsaken thy dutie.
She hath not seene her brother since he departed for the warres.
The messenger arriued at noone with newes of great importance.
I beseech thee to shew mercy vpon these poore wretched soules.
His countenance was most greeuous and full of sorrowful teares.
We must hasten our iourney lest we be ouertaken by nightfall.
The courtiers did make merrie and daunced till the breake of dawn.
